# E-Commerce Store (MERN Stack)

## Description
This e-commerce store is a full-stack application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The application leverages third-party APIs to enhance its functionality and supports three main user flows:

- **Buyers:** Browse through store categories, products, and brands.
- **Sellers/Merchants:** Manage brand components, add/update/delete products, and monitor sales.
- **Admins:** Oversee the entire store, including user management, order processing, and inventory control.

## Features

- **Node.js:** Provides a robust backend environment for handling multiple requests and ensuring high performance.
- **Express.js:** Used as middleware to manage HTTP requests and routes, simplifying the development of a secure and scalable web application.
- **Mongoose Schemas:** Models the application data structure in MongoDB, ensuring consistency and providing powerful querying capabilities.
- **React.js:** Powers the frontend with reusable UI components for a dynamic and responsive user experience.
- **Redux:** Manages the application's state, offering a predictable state container that synchronizes state across different components.
- **Redux Thunk:** Middleware used to handle asynchronous operations within Redux, especially for managing API calls and data flow between frontend and backend.
